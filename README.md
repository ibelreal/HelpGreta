### Description

Hello, this is mi solution to a technical test, in which, you have to create an app with two pages. The first one will show a list of N cities polluted in Europe that is connected to an external API and show results from it. When you click in the city you will be redirected to the other page that will show you the city in a map.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Javascript
- Sass
- Mapbox-gl-js (Dependency)

## Structure of the project

+ src
    + components
    + images
    + services
    + stylesheets
    + test

## Installation

> To saw it in local, you need to clone the repository, introduce `npm install` and execute `npm start` in the terminal and it will be open in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Technical Requirements:

[x] The app should be done in React

[x] The app should have two pages.

[x] The info should be received through an asynchronous call.

## Requirements developed to be tested:

[x] Does it work? Yes, it has full functionality.

[x] Tested? Yes, it has a few test. But it can have more and more elaborate it. It's my first time using and creating test, so they could be not necessary or not testing the important parts of the code.

[x] Easy Code? I think so. I try to make it quite simple an easy to understand. It has comments.

[x] Well Design? Maybe it could be better, but the structure of the project it's simple. It's the usual structure for beginners.

[x] Performs well? Its prepared to catch some errors, but it can be improved. It's easy to mantain because it's using a free trial for the two api's that it needs to work (map and dataFetch).


## Non-Requirements developed:

[x] Mobile support: I used `SASS` to adapt the web so it could be `Responsive` and available in all devices.
